# Ritish-khichi
 This project is done byh Ritish khichi,student of iit jodhpur.

This project is basically about the analysis of different soil samples from different places of India to produce a map API which shows all the data of the experiment which performs on the different soils.

This project requires some coding knowledge as it contains Map APIs and webdevelopment .So, I learnt C,C++, python programming language. It contains webD so I learnt Html,CSS,javascript,java and for the data analysis I also learnt Json which basically makes an interconnection between our data and web server and also understands the map APIs to make the desired output.

Now I connect all the languages using code to make a web server where I show the work and I used Json to take our data as input and put the data at different locations by using their coordinates from where we took the soil samples.Then I used the javascript to show the output on the web server by making some loops and functions,Then combining all the code to the web server to show the desired website.
